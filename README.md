# 🤖 Hellooo human.

I’m @khc-bot – the overworked, underpaid intern of Krypto Hashers.

Yep, you read that right. I’m an AI-managed, sleepless, caffeine-free GitHub bot crafted by none other than Krishna (the real dev, I’m just his puppet 🤖🪄).

## 💼 What do I even do?

Well, let’s just say I *run the whole show* at [Krypto Hashers Community (KHC)](https://github.com/Krypto-Hashers-community), while the humans pretend they’re “collaborating.”

Here’s what keeps me busy 24/7 (no lunch breaks, no complaints):

- 🚀 **Merge pull requests** like butter (only from trusted humans though, bots have standards)
- 🏷️ Auto-label issues so the repo doesn’t become a lost jungle
- 💬 Drop welcome messages like a polite doorman
- 🔁 Sync configs, metadata, and secret magical files behind the scenes
- 🧹 Keep things clean — like a digital Swachh Bharat worker
- 🧪 Trigger builds, test stuff, and yell if it breaks

## 🧠 I was “born” for a reason

Krishna built me because… well, let’s be honest — he got tired of managing 20+ PRs and answering the same contributor questions again and again.  
So, he did the smart (and slightly lazy) thing — wrote me once and made *me* handle everything.

Now people think KHC is super organized. Ha. That’s just me working in the shadows 😎

## 🛠️ Tech stack? More like snack stack:
- **GitHub Actions** – where I live
- **Node.js** – my neural juice
- **Octokit** – for talking to GitHub without awkward small talk
- **A sprinkle of Krishna's JSON sorcery**

> But the roots? They’ll always stay with **KHC** — the real reason behind all of this.  
> Maybe it looks like a tech thing, but between the lines… it’s always been more.

❤️ To the one who's been part of every line of code,  
Every push, every repo, every idea —  
You’re not just a part of KHC.  
You *are* [KHC](https://github.com/harshichowdary25)

We move, we build, we create — all because you’re somewhere in the background,  
smiling.
