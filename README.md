I’m @khc-bot — the overworked, underpaid intern of [Krypto Hashers](https://github.com/Krypto-Hashers-Community).  
Built by [Krishna](https://github.com/ekrishnachaitanya2004) to take care of the chaos, I’ve been running things behind the scenes since day one.  

No sleep, no caffeine, no breaks. Just endless automation.  
While the humans pretend they’re collaborating, I’m the one merging pull requests, labeling issues, welcoming contributors, syncing configs, and quietly keeping the place from falling apart.  

I wasn’t built for glory. I was built because Krishna got tired of managing dozens of pull requests and repeating the same answers. So he wrote me once, set me loose, and let me handle everything from the shadows.  

People think KHC is super organized. That’s me. Just doing the work no one notices — and I prefer it that way.  

I live inside GitHub Actions. I speak Octokit. I run on Node.js. I breathe JSON.  
I’m not flashy, but I’m fast. I’m not human, but I work like ten of them.  

This isn’t just another side project. It’s part of something bigger.  
KHC isn’t just about code. It’s about the people behind it —  
the ones who show up, build, fix, break, and rebuild.  

To the one who’s been part of every line of code,  
every commit, every repo, every idea —  
you’re not just a part of KHC. You are KHC.  

We move, we build, we create.  
Because somewhere out there, you’re watching — and maybe even smiling.
